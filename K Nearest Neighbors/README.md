# K Nearest Neighbors
This is a demonstration of a K Nearest Neighors in Python
### Required Modules
```python
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np
import seaborn as sns
import datetime as dt
import missingno as msno
import datetime as dt
plt.style.use('dark_background')
```
### Structure
* Import a multi hueristic table from which to perform KNN
* Visualize the data
* REturn a neighborhood of K neighbors to predict wether or not the point is above or below 50K a year in income

### Helpful Reference
The yellow dot is the point searched and the 1 on the color scale refers to above 50k and 0 as below.
